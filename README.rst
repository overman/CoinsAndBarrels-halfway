Coins And Barrels

:Description: Implementation that is halfway to "classic" Hark the Sound compatible. 

Overview
=============

A half-way implementation of Coins and Barrels. All the game specific data has been pulled out into a JSON. What was once the coins and barrels application is now setup to be a game engine for another class of Hark the Sound games, experimentally named as "reaction games" at this point. 

Past Setup
=============

At the very beginning, coins and barrels was a game made for Maze Day 2010. It ran as a executable. It was then ported over to run in the browser. This version is the next step after that.

Future Setup
=============

The machinery is almost set up now for the application.js to become 'reactionGameEngine.js' to fit into the framework for the "classic" hark the sound games. All that needs to really be done is make the application into a dijit.widget. At that point the game will be placed over in the hark architecture however. 

Other Notes
=============

No sounds or images are up here.
